The Iconostasis is now stained! Thank God! We went with a darker stain than we
were initially thinking, but I think it was the right choice. I was afraid of
seeing so much grain, but the contrast is nice. I still need to apply a finish
to it, but, to most people, it is "done".

I have a few more things to do on the back side of it. I will add some shelves
for service books and come up with a way to hang the altar boy's torches.

This was a fun and incredibly rewarding project. Thank God for allowing me to
do this for our community and helping me along the way. I certainly did not do
this alone, there are several members of our community that helped so much
along the way.

Glory to God for all things!
