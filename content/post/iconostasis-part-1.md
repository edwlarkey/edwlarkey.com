Христосъ воскресе!

We recently completed building a new Orthodox church. We have been working
toward this as a community for 17 years. Once the building was completed, it
was time for us to move in. One thing that wasn't part of the building project
is the iconostasis. An iconostasis is a wall that separates the nave from the
sanctuary that has icons facing the nave. [Wikipedia article on iconostasis
here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconostasis). Father coordinated some
volunteers for the design and the building project was mostly handed to me to
complete.

With the help of a few other volunteers, we have made good progress in time for
Pascha. We inherited the icons from another church that, sadly, closed several
years ago. The icons were written on Mount Athos and are quite beautiful.

We began by building out from the walls by anchoring some 2x boards to the wall
and building a box/column around them. Then another box/column was added next
and screwed to the previous one. Some door frame material was cut to the right
dimensions for the archangel doors and nailed and screwed in place. The next
section towards the center is actually a piece of our original "temporary"
iconostasis that a parishioner made several years ago. It is installed onto a
new base that is anchored to the concrete. The main icon sections are attached to
the two side columns with two 2x4s stacked on top of one another and screwed
together to add some rigidity and provide the top of the door frame. A top rail
was attached to the face of the main icon sections to tie everything together.

The archangel doors were pretty narrow, so in our new church we wanted to make
them wider so it is more comfortable for Father to walk through them with
vestments on and holding the gifts. I laminated some oak boards together to
match the thickness of the door and screwed them to the sides of the door
before mortising the hinges and installing.

This has taken several weeks so far. Finding time and energy during the fast
has been difficult at times, but I am very happy with what we have accomplished.
Thank God!
